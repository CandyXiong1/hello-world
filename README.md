＃ 你好，世界
Then I finally learned how to love

Unfortunately, you have long gone disappeared in the crowd

Then finally in tears understand

Some people once miss not at

Gardenia white petals

Fell on my blue pleated skirt

Love you, you whisper

I looked down and smelled the fragrance

The eternal night

Seventeen in the middle of summer

The night you kissed me

Let me back time

Whenever there's an exclamation

Always think of the stars in the day

Love at that time

Why is it that simple

And why are people young

Make sure the loved one gets hurt

On a similar night

Whether you also quietly regret sentimental

If we could not be so stubborn

It's not so bad now

How do you remember me

With a smile or very silent

Is there anyone who can keep you from being lonely all these years

Then I finally learned how to love

Unfortunately, you have long gone disappeared in the crowd

Then finally in tears understand

Some people once miss not at

How do you remember me

With a smile or very silent

Is there anyone who can keep you from being lonely all these years

Then I finally learned how to love

Unfortunately, you have long gone disappeared in the crowd

Then finally in tears understand

Some people once miss not at

Then I finally learned how to love

Unfortunately, you have long gone disappeared in the crowd

Then finally in tears understand

Some people once miss not at

It will never happen again

There is a boy in love with that girl
